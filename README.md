# Confusion-Matrix
* Created a user defined function for confusion matrix table in python
* A confusion matrix is a table that is used to define the performance of a classification algorithm. The matrix is typically used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier
* True Positives (TP) - These are the cases where the model predicted the positive class and the true value is also positive.
* True Negatives (TN) - These are the cases where the model predicted the negative class and the true value is also negative.
* False Positives (FP) - These are the cases where the model predicted the positive class but the true value is negative.
* False Negatives (FN) - These are the cases where the model predicted the negative class but the true value is positive.
